                    Asues to evolve, JavaScript usage continues to rise.

      <h2>top 3 programming languages</h2>
            <p>Python continues to be one of the best programming languages every developer should learn this year. The
                language is easy-to-learn and offers a clean and well-structured code, making it powerful enough to
                build a decent web application.
            </p>

            <p>Java is celebrating its 24th birthday this year and has been one of the most popular programming
                languages used for developing server-side applications. Java is a practical choice for developing
                Android apps as it can be used to create highly functional programs and platforms.
            </p>

            <p>JavaScript (also known as NodeJS) is a popular language among developers who need to work on server-side
                and client-side programming. It is compatible with several other programming languages, allowing you to
                create animations, set up buttons, and manage multimedia.

                    <h3>Computer programmer</h3>
                    <p>Computer programmers write and edit code for computer software programs and ensure the programs
                        run with no errors. Computer programmers solve any issues or problems that arise during the
                        coding process, and they make sure that the final product meets their clients’ standards. They
                        might also be responsible for training others to use their programs once they are complete.</p>

                    <h3>Web developer</h3>
                    <p>Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for both how the site looks and
                        how it functions. They will test and evaluate a site to make sure it meets quality standards
                        before it is released. After the site is published, they monitor the site’s continued
                        performance and troubleshoot any technical problems that might arise. They ensure that their
                        websites and programs meet current security standards.</p>

                    <h3>Programmer analyst</h3>
                    <p>Programming analysis can be a compelling career because a career as a programmer analyst combines
                        the jobs of a systems analyst and a computer programmer. Like most programming professionals,
                        programmer analysts design and create computer software and programs. Working with other
                        computer programmers, a programmer analyst then oversees the writing of the code necessary to
                        create and publish the programs.</p>

          <p>Usually, large companies and organizations have a vast army of human resources working under
              them. In such scenarios where there’s a significant number of human employees to manage, it
              becomes challenging to supervise and manage the activities of the human resources efficiently.
              Such companies/organizations need an advanced employee management system that can handle
              everything related to the company’s human resources.</p>
